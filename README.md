# kerutils
* Python Tensorflow/Keras Utilities required for my
  [deep learning notebooks](http://www.samyzaf.com/ML)
* Some of the utilities (especially those in imgutils.py) are specifically designated for the examples
  in my
  [deep learning notebooks](http://www.samyzaf.com/ML),
  but can easily be tailored for general usage if desired.
